    "# Resampling Methods (MACS 30100)\n",
    "### by [Richard W. Evans](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon/), February 2018\n",
    "The code in this Jupyter notebook was written using Python 3.6. It uses data files [`Titanic dataset`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigDataGal/Python-for-Data-Science/master/titanic-train.csv). For the code to run properly, you will either need to have access to the internet or you should have the data file in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook file. Otherwise, you will have to change the respective lines of the code that read in the data to reflect the location of that data. Some of this content was taken from Dr. Benjamin Soltoff's resampling methods notes [here](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/persp006_resampling.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling methods are a way to test the sensitivity of statistical results to estimation using a different sample. It is often too difficult or too expensive to draw a new sample from the population. Resampling methods take advantage of the training-set test-set paradigm to evaluate the sensitivity of estimates to sample variance. The two main classes of resampling methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cross validation\n",
    "2. Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In choosing models to predict or match data or to infer relationships between variables, James, et al (2013) decompose the process into *model assessment* and *model selection*. Model assessment is treated in this notebook. It is the process and various means of evaluating the fit or accuracy of a given model. Model selection is the process of adjusting parameters, variables, or functional relationships between variables to better fit the data."
